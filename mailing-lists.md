SeaJUG hosts two discussion groups using the freely available [Yahoo! Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/) service. This service provides mailing list management, list archives, and other convenient features. To subscribe to the discussion groups, follow the links below:

## Technical Discussion List
The SeaJUG list is intended as a forum for the **discussion of technical and practical issues** related to the the use of the Java language, as well as announcements of meetings or other events that would be of interest to the SeaJUG community.

**Postings of a commercial nature are expressly frowned upon. Continued posting eligibility is subject to adherence to the list charter.**

## Local Jobs List
Use this list if you wish to keep abreast of Java opportunities, or would like to send **job announcements**.

**Please keep in mind that:**
- they must be **focused on JAVA or JVM related languages like Scala, etc, NOT JavaScript, C++, C#** or otherwise.
- they should be focused on the **Puget Sound** job market. They should definitely not be based overseas - there are other forums for this (google it).

**Continued posting eligibility is subject to adherence to the list charter.**

Note that the list moderator has to approve all membership requests to avoid any spam on the list. This could take a day or two at most. Thanks for your patience. If you haven't for a response for a few days, the email could be sitting in your spam folder. Contact the SeaJUG chair if you don't get a response within a few days at most.
