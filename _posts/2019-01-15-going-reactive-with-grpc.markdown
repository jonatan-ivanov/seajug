gRPC is Google's option for establishing two-way communication between two network connected entities. This technology allows you to stream data from one side to the other and back again, or to/from both sides at the same time!
See: [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/seajug/events/257801491/) and [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/aalmiray/going-reactive-with-grpc)

Meanwhile ReactiveStreams implementations such as RxJava and Project Reactor let you define data pipelines that send data cross the wire. What if it were possible to combine both? Well you're in luck because it turns out you can! gRPC brings to the table HTTP2, security, encryption and a binary protocol while ReactiveStreams brings a multitude of operations (such as composition, filtering, transformations) that make it easier to work with flows of data. Come learn how these two technologies may help you in your daily job.
