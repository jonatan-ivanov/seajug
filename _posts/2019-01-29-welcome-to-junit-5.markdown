JUnit 5 has been out for a year, so what is the big fuss and why should I take the time to update my existing automated tests to use JUnit 5? In this presentation we will look at many of the new features that have been added in JUnit 5 and not only how they make automated testing easier, but allow developers to write tests in ways that were difficult or impossible to do before. If you have been wondering why you should make the switch from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 you will definitely want to check out this presentation.
