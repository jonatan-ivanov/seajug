[Micronaut](http://micronaut.io/) is a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice applications. In this session we'll dive deep into Micronaut, it's strengths, capabilities and best practices when building & testing services, functions and reactive apps.

Michael is also a world renowned magician and will display some of his skills. Check out http://bit.ly/2LG7GmK and http://bit.ly/2LGDg3Y.

# Speaker: Michael Carducci
For nearly 20 years, Michael was a software engineer moonlighting as a magician. Now he's a magician moonlighting as a software engineer. In both endeavors he has dedicated himself to mastery and has gained deep insights both from his eclectic interests, entrepreneurial spirit, and experience that spans the full stack, the entire project lifecycle, and several technologies.

His time is equally divided between performing around the world, jumping out of perfectly good airplanes, and building software that doesn't suck.
