In a world where Microservices and CI/CD is the norm, how do we make software testing simpler? How do we make it easy to explain, to understand and to write? Can we provide developers and framework makers a unified testing tool to make their lives simpler? I think we can, but first, we have to define the job to be done and reimagine software testing.
