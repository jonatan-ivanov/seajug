[CUBA Platform](https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba) is an open source Java framework for rapid enterprise application development. CUBA allows to develop application much faster using a well-known set of frameworks: [Spring](https://spring.io/), [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/), [EclipseLink](http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/) and more.
See: [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/seajug/events/255160017/)

We've spent our time developing CUBA, adding extra functionality to frameworks so you won't spend your time on implementing common tasks like user management, security and audit, generic REST API, etc. CUBA provides plenty of features out of the box and you will still be using well-known frameworks during development. In addition to this we will introduce the unique application extension approach that both ensures internal extensibility and facilitates external components development.

In this presentation we will talk about the framework using both presentation and live coding session, hoping to hear provocative questions sparking a proper, deeply technical discussion.

Since 2008, Aleksey participated in multiple enterprise software projects, in positions ranging from a developer to a project manager, leading teams of 50+ developers. He has been involved in the entire development cycle, from architecture design to final delivery of large scale projects for blue chip companies, primarily in the oil & gas industry. This mix of technical and management experience has enabled Aleksey to gain in-depth understanding of business applications development. Aleksey joined the CUBA Platform team in 2013 and has played a key role in R&D, development of the framework features and roadmap.

Andrey started his career in 2001 as a developer in the team that was working on a software for oil producing companies using Oracle's technology stack (PL/SQL, Forms, Reports), and learned Java meanwhile. Since 2006 and till 2018 Andrey has been working for several outsourcing companies. During this period, he participated in various projects - starting from RFID labels tracking to social networks, and was involved in various tasks - from development to architecture design, account management and pre-sales meetings with clients. Now Andrey works as a developer advocate and contributes to the development of CUBA Platform.
