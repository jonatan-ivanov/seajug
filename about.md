The Seattle Java User's group has been meeting since the mid-90s in the Seattle and Eastside area. It is geared towards topics related to the Java Virtual Machine and languages which run on it such as Java, etc. You can find us on [meetup.com/seajug](https://www.meetup.com/seajug/).

*SeaJUG is an all volunteer effort* - which means items such as the website and mailing list are updated as schedules afford. We meet on the 3rd Tuesday of every month. We need suggestions/volunteers for topics! If you'd like to donate your time/skills to the cause, please contact [Nimret Sandhu](mailto:nimret@nimret.org).

**Chair:** Nimret Sandhu  
**Community Leaders:** Freddy Guime, Ben Garnaat  
**Founder:** Jayson Raymond
